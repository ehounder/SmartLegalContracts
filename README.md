The blockchains that survive will be the ones people use. Furthermore, with the advent of AI the most successful blockchains will be those which optimize the human-AI web3-blockchain UI interactions.

Initially the blockdocuments.org standard retail form UI operates on the XRP Ledger via Xaman (formerly Xumm) wallet API signing for a Wyoming Motor Vehicle Bill of Sale generating a PDF download with txhash links. Users have the option to record the PDFâ†’PNG-GIF converted images as Sologenic SOLO NFTs.

Users manually enter in the retail form {key:value} pairs, however with the advent of AI and the Oraichain LLM data sources, future development is conceivable to be practical along the lines of AI-prompted AI-transacted retail forms of public record.

Retail forms UI workflow follows conventional expectations of first verifying items, identities of parties, agreeing on price, signing of the document, finalized by payment and transferring of material items.

BlockDocuments supports cross-blockchain and platform scalability via operating entirely through the web3 browser with the blockchain backend hence of lightest weight for the internet and mobile service provider networks for all the surviving blockchains.

Future development is towards incorporating via smart contract logic a partial payment into the main payment payload analogous to a small credit card fee for hosting the transaction in a vendor app.
