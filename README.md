The blockchains that survive will be the ones people use, which means providing an optimized user interface for the human-AI web3 interactions.

Initially the smartlegalcontracts.net traditional natural language legally binding agreements and standard retail forms UI operates on the XRP Ledger via Xaman (formerly Xumm) wallet API signing for a Wyoming Motor Vehicle Bill of Sale generating a PDF download with txhash links. Users have the option to record the PDFâ†’PNG-GIF converted images as Sologenic SOLO NFTs.

Users manually enter in the retail form {key:value} pairs, however with the advent of AI agents, future development is conceivable to be practical along the lines of AI-prompted AI-transacted retail forms of public record.

Retail forms UI workflow follows conventional expectations of first verifying items, identities of parties, agreeing on price, signing of the document, finalized by payment and transferring of material items.

Smart Legal Contracts LLC supports cross-blockchain and platform scalability via operating entirely through the web3 browser with the blockchain backend hence of lightest weight for the internet and mobile service provider networks for all the surviving blockchains.

Future development is a test platform for the Batch Amendment XLS-56 multipayments for a Seller of a product or service and a website agency fee or Legal fee equivalent to a credit card transaction.
